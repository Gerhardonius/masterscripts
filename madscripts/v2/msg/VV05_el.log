  === Results Summary for run: run_01 tag: tag_1 ===

     Cross-section :   0.6041 +- 0.0007093 pb
     Nb of events :  50000
     Pythia8 merged cross-sections are:
      > Merging scale = 15     : 0.069715    +/- 1.2e-05 [pb]
      > Merging scale = 22.5   : 0.079562    +/- 1.3e-05 [pb]
      > Merging scale = 30     : 0.082848    +/- 1.3e-05 [pb]
     Notice that because Systematics computation is turned on, the merging did not veto events but modified their weights instead.
     The resulting hepmc/stdhep file should therefore be use with those weights.

     Notice that because Systematics computation is turned on, the merging did not veto events but modified their weights instead.
     The resulting hepmc/stdhep file should therefore be use with those weights.

     Cross-section :   0.6039 +- 0.0007232 pb
     Nb of events :  50000
     Pythia8 merged cross-sections are:
      > Merging scale = 15     : 0.072935    +/- 1.2e-05 [pb]
      > Merging scale = 22.5   : 0.081099    +/- 1.3e-05 [pb]
      > Merging scale = 30     : 0.083176    +/- 1.3e-05 [pb]
     Notice that because Systematics computation is turned on, the merging did not veto events but modified their weights instead.
     The resulting hepmc/stdhep file should therefore be use with those weights.

      > Merging scale = 30     : 0.085879    +/- 1.3e-05 [pb]
     Notice that because Systematics computation is turned on, the merging did not veto events but modified their weights instead.
     The resulting hepmc/stdhep file should therefore be use with those weights.

     Cross-section :   0.6045 +- 0.0007148 pb
     Nb of events :  50000
     Pythia8 merged cross-sections are:
      > Merging scale = 15     : 0.071981    +/- 1.2e-05 [pb]
      > Merging scale = 22.5   : 0.081762    +/- 1.3e-05 [pb]
      > Merging scale = 30     : 0.085364    +/- 1.3e-05 [pb]
     Notice that because Systematics computation is turned on, the merging did not veto events but modified their weights instead.
     The resulting hepmc/stdhep file should therefore be use with those weights.

     Pythia8 merged cross-sections are:

      > Merging scale = 22.5   : 0.078985    +/- 1.3e-05 [pb]
      > Merging scale = 30     : 0.08297     +/- 1.3e-05 [pb]
     Notice that because Systematics computation is turned on, the merging did not veto events but modified their weights instead.
     The resulting hepmc/stdhep file should therefore be use with those weights.

     Pythia8 merged cross-sections are:
      > Merging scale = 15     : 1451.4      +/- 0.15    [pb]
      > Merging scale = 22.5   : 1537.5      +/- 0.16    [pb]
      > Merging scale = 30     : 1567.5      +/- 0.16    [pb]
     Notice that because Systematics computation is turned on, the merging did not veto events but modified their weights instead.
     The resulting hepmc/stdhep file should therefore be use with those weights.

     Nb of events :  50000
     Pythia8 merged cross-sections are:
      > Merging scale = 15     : 1476        +/- 0.16    [pb]
      > Merging scale = 22.5   : 1570.4      +/- 0.16    [pb]
      > Merging scale = 30     : 1581.1      +/- 0.16    [pb]
     Notice that because Systematics computation is turned on, the merging did not veto events but modified their weights instead.
     The resulting hepmc/stdhep file should therefore be use with those weights.

  === Results Summary for run: run_09 tag: tag_1 ===

     Cross-section :   4788 +- 5.004 pb
     Nb of events :  50000
     Pythia8 merged cross-sections are:
      > Merging scale = 15     : 1459.5      +/- 0.16    [pb]
      > Merging scale = 22.5   : 1570.1      +/- 0.16    [pb]
      > Merging scale = 30     : 1587.7      +/- 0.16    [pb]
     Notice that because Systematics computation is turned on, the merging did not veto events but modified their weights instead.
     The resulting hepmc/stdhep file should therefore be use with those weights.

  === Results Summary for run: run_10 tag: tag_1 ===

     Cross-section :   4794 +- 5.326 pb
     Nb of events :  50000
     Pythia8 merged cross-sections are:
      > Merging scale = 15     : 1454.5      +/- 0.15    [pb]
      > Merging scale = 22.5   : 1547.9      +/- 0.16    [pb]
      > Merging scale = 30     : 1567.3      +/- 0.16    [pb]
     Notice that because Systematics computation is turned on, the merging did not veto events but modified their weights instead.
     The resulting hepmc/stdhep file should therefore be use with those weights.

     Pythia8 merged cross-sections are:
      > Merging scale = 15     : 1460.9      +/- 0.16    [pb]
      > Merging scale = 22.5   : 1543.7      +/- 0.16    [pb]
      > Merging scale = 30     : 1560        +/- 0.16    [pb]
     Notice that because Systematics computation is turned on, the merging did not veto events but modified their weights instead.
     The resulting hepmc/stdhep file should therefore be use with those weights.

     Cross-section :   4788 +- 5.012 pb
     Nb of events :  50000
     Pythia8 merged cross-sections are:
      > Merging scale = 15     : 1487.8      +/- 0.16    [pb]
      > Merging scale = 22.5   : 1571.6      +/- 0.16    [pb]
      > Merging scale = 30     : 1584.2      +/- 0.16    [pb]
     Notice that because Systematics computation is turned on, the merging did not veto events but modified their weights instead.
     The resulting hepmc/stdhep file should therefore be use with those weights.
