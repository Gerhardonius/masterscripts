     Notice that because Systematics computation is turned on, the merging did not veto events but modified their weights instead.
     The resulting hepmc/stdhep file should therefore be use with those weights.

 you can also
   - enter the path to a valid card or banner.
   - use the 'set' command to modify a parameter directly.
     The set option works only for param_card and run_card.
     Type 'help set' for more information on this command.
   - call an external program (ASperGE/MadWidth/...).

  === Results Summary for run: run_02 tag: tag_1 ===

     Cross-section :   4791 +- 5.24 pb
     Nb of events :  50000
     Pythia8 merged cross-sections are:
      > Merging scale = 15     : 1470.9      +/- 0.16    [pb]
      > Merging scale = 22.5   : 1569.4      +/- 0.16    [pb]
      > Merging scale = 30     : 1592.5      +/- 0.16    [pb]
     Notice that because Systematics computation is turned on, the merging did not veto events but modified their weights instead.
     The resulting hepmc/stdhep file should therefore be use with those weights.
